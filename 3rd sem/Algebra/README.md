## Abstract / Summary

This project demonstrates the deep and elegant connection between the popular Rubik's Cube puzzle and the mathematical field of Group Theory. The report models the set of all possible cube states and the moves that transform them as a permutation group. By defining cube moves as group elements and concatenation as the binary operator, we explore fundamental concepts such as permutations, subgroups, order, cosets, and Lagrange's Theorem to provide a formal structure for understanding the puzzle. This framework explains why solution algorithms (macros) are effective and not impossibly difficult to discover.

## Key Concepts Covered

* Group Theory Axioms (Closure, Associativity, Identity, Inverse)
* Permutation Groups & Cycle Notation
* Parity of Permutations
* Subgroups (generated by specific move sets)
* Order of a Group Element
* Cosets
* Lagrange's Theorem

## Tools & Methods 

* Typst: Used for writing the report

## Outcomes & Learnings 

* The primary outcome is a clear demonstration that the Rubik's Cube is a physical manifestation of a mathematical group, with an enormous but finite number of states.
* The key insight gained is that using the structure of group theory, particularly the concept of subgroups and commutators, provides a systematic way to solve the cube layer-by-layer, transforming a seemingly chaotic puzzle into a structured problem.
