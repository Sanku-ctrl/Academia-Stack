## Abstract / Summary

This presentation explores the foundations of metric spaces and their applications in
the field of search engines. We’ll delve into the core concepts of metric spaces, discuss
their importance in indexing and retrieval techniques, and examine how they contribute
to efficient and effective search results.

## Key Concepts Covered

* Metric Spaces & their properties
* Similarity Search & Query Types (k-NN, Range)
* Metric Index Structures (Ball Partitioning, Hyper-plane Partitioning)
* Approximate Similarity Search (ANN)
* Performance Metrics (Precision, Recall, Efficiency)
* The Curse of Dimensionality
* Concentration of Distances Phenomenon

---

## Tools & Methods 

* LaTeX

## Outcomes & Learnings 

* A key finding is that while traditional metric spaces provide a robust framework for search, their effectiveness diminishes in high-dimensional data due to the Curse of Dimensionality.
* This necessitates the use of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and specialized techniques like dimensionality reduction to maintain both speed and relevance in modern search engines.
