## Abstract / Summary

This presentation explores the foundations of metric spaces and their applications in
the field of search engines. Weâ€™ll delve into the core concepts of metric spaces, discuss
their importance in indexing and retrieval techniques, and examine how they contribute
to efficient and effective search results.

## Key Concepts Covered

* Metric Spaces & their properties
* Similarity Search & Query Types (k-NN, Range)
* Metric Index Structures (Ball Partitioning, Hyper-plane Partitioning)
* Approximate Similarity Search (ANN)
* Performance Metrics (Precision, Recall, Efficiency)
* The Curse of Dimensionality
* Concentration of Distances Phenomenon

## Tools & Methods 

* LaTeX

## Outcomes & Learnings *(Optional)*

* A key finding is that while traditional metric spaces provide a robust framework for search, their effectiveness diminishes in high-dimensional data due to the Curse of Dimensionality.
* This necessitates the use of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and specialized techniques like dimensionality reduction to maintain both speed and relevance in modern search engines.
