## Abstract / Summary

This project analyzes how the occurrence of cardiac arrests can be modeled as a Poisson process, a type of stochastic process used for random, rare events over time. The work focuses on two core components: the theoretical formulation of the Poisson process and its relationship to the exponential distribution for inter-arrival times, and a simulation in R that generates synthetic cardiac arrest data based on known statistical rates. The goal is to demonstrate how well real-world data aligns with the Poisson model and what implications this has for Emergency Medical Service (EMS) planning and healthcare logistics.

## Outcomes & Learnings 

* The simulation successfully supported the hypothesis that cardiac arrests can be effectively modeled using a Poisson process, as indicated by high P-values in goodness-of-fit tests.
* The project highlights how a simple, one-parameter model can provide powerful insights for real-world resource allocation problems like EMS staffing and resource deployment.
