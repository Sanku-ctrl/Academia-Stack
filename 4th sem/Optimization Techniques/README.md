## Abstract / Summary

This project focuses on applying Linear Programming (LP) techniques to solve a real-world inventory management problem for a retail store. The primary objective was to minimize the total procurement cost of products while satisfying constraints related to budget, storage capacity, and minimum customer demand. We formulated the problem mathematically, established a cost-minimizing objective function, and applied both the graphical method for a two-variable case and the Simplex method for a higher-dimensional problem to find the optimal stocking quantities.
