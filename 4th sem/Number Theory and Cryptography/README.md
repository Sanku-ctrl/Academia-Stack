## Abstract / Summary

The rapid progress in quantum computing poses a serious threat to existing cryptographic systems. This report provides an introduction to the field of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), which aims to develop schemes secure against quantum adversaries. While we briefly survey the primary approaches to PQC, the project's core focus is a **deep dive into Lattice-based Cryptography**, one of the most promising and actively researched areas. The report provides a detailed analysis of its foundational hardness assumptions and a review of key lattice-based cryptosystems.

## Outcomes & Learnings 

* A key takeaway is the urgency for the transition to quantum-resistant algorithms, as the development and deployment of new cryptographic standards is a multi-decade process.
* The project provides a clear understanding that different PQC approaches offer distinct trade-offs between efficiency (speed, key size) and security assumptions, which is critical for selecting the right algorithms for future systems.
